story: "To further my knowledge of WordPress, I challenged myself to design and code this theme. I put together common website components and designed a rough layout mock-up in Figma. Then I coded everything from scratch to create a responsive html site with basic functionality for a custom slider and a mobile menu. In this project I learned about the WP Template Hiearchy, Queries, Custom Post Types, Advanced Custom Fields and a few other things. Also hosting and migrating a WordPress database from development or staging to production."
